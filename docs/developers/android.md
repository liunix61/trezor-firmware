# Android

You can use Android API in Java in order to use Trezor in your Android
app. Note that the mobile phone needs to support OTG connection and the
user needs to have an OTG cable to connect Trezor device to the
phone.

*See more documentation on the [GitHub page][].*

Examples of Android applications that integrate with Trezor using the
trezor-android API:

-   [Mycelium][]
-   [Walleth][]
